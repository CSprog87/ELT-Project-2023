### dataset

It has all the .csvs with the information that will be used in the project.

- `dataset/olist_customers_dataset.csv`: csv with info regarding the location of the customers.
- `dataset/olist_order_items_dataset.csv`: csv with info regarding the shipping.
- `dataset/olist_order_payments_dataset.csv`: csv with info regarding the payment.
- `dataset/olist_order_reviews_dataset.csv`: csv with info regarding the clients' reviews.
- `dataset/olist_orders_dataset.csv`: csv with info regarding the different dates of each sale's process.
- `dataset/olist_products_dataset.csv`: csv with info regarding the details of each product.
- `dataset/olist_sellers_dataset.csv`: csv with info regarding the location of the sellers.
- `dataset/product_category_name_translation.csv`: csv with info regarding the translation of each category from Portuguese to English.

### queries

It contains all the SQL queries and the code you will need to complete, to later create tables and plots.

- `queries/delivery_date_difference.sql`: This query will return a table with two columns; State, and Delivery_Difference. The first one will have the letters that identify the states, and the second one the average difference between the estimated delivery date and the date when the items were actually delivered to the customer.
- `queries/global_ammount_order_status.sql`: This query will return a table with two columns; order_status, and Amount. The first one will have the different order status classes and the second one the total amount of each.
- `queries/real_vs_estimated_delivered_time.sql`: This query will return a table with the differences between the real and estimated delivery times by month and year. It will have different columns: month_no, with the month numbers going from 01 to 12; month, with the 3 first letters of each month (e.g. Jan, Feb); Year2016_real_time, with the average delivery time per month of 2016 (NaN if it doesn't exist); Year2017_real_time, with the average delivery time per month of 2017 (NaN if it doesn't exist); Year2018_real_time, with the average delivery time per month of 2018 (NaN if it doesn't exist); Year2016_estimated_time, with the average estimated delivery time per month of 2016 (NaN if it doesn't exist); Year2017_estimated_time, with the average estimated delivery time per month of 2017 (NaN if it doesn't exist) and Year2018_estimated_time, with the average estimated delivery time per month of 2018 (NaN if it doesn't exist).
- `queries/revenue_by_month_year.sql`: This query will return a table with the revenue by month and year. It will have different columns: month_no, with the month numbers going from 01 to 12; month, with the 3 first letters of each month (e.g. Jan, Feb); Year2016, with the revenue per month of 2016 (0.00 if it doesn't exist); Year2017, with the revenue per month of 2017 (0.00 if it doesn't exist) and Year2018, with the revenue per month of 2018 (0.00 if it doesn't exist).
- `queries/revenue_per_state.sql`: This query will return a table with two columns; customer_state, and Revenue. The first one will have the letters that identify the top 10 states with the most revenue and the second one the total revenue of each.
- `queries/top_10_least_revenue_categories.sql`: This query will return a table with the top 10 least revenue categories in English, the number of orders, and their total revenue. The first column will be Category, which will contain the top 10 least revenue categories; the second one will be Num_order, with the total amount of orders of each category; and the last one will be Revenue, with the total revenue of each category.
- `queries/top_10_revenue_catgories.sql`: This query will return a table with the top 10 revenue categories in English, the number of orders, and their total revenue. The first column will be Category, which will contain the top 10 revenue categories; the second one will be Num_order, with the total amount of orders of each category; and the last one will be Revenue, with the total revenue of each category.

### src

The source that contains different files needed for the whole project to work.

- `src/_init__.py`: File required to make Python treat directories containing the other files in the folder as a package.
- `src/config.py`: File that contains the configuration of root paths.
- `src/extract.py`: File that extracts the data from the .csv and API files and loads them into dataframes.
- `src/load.py`: File that loads the dataframes into the SQLite databases.
- `src/plots.py`: File where all the plotting functions are.
- `src/transform.py`: File that transforms the queries into tables.

### tests

Folder with the necessary files to test the project.

- query_results: This folder contains all the .json files that will be used to test the queries you created.
- `tests/_init__.py`: File required to make Python treat directories containing the other files in the folder as a package.
- `tests/test_extract.py`: File that tests if the query functions have been extracted properly.
- `tests/test_transform.py`: File that tests if the query functions have been created in the proper tables.
